That i want thee, only thee - let my heart repeat without end. 
All desires that distract me, day and night are unfounded and hollow to my little heart.
As the night keeps hidden, in its mist the petition of thine light, even thus in the depth of my slumber rings the cry - "I want thee and only thee!".
As the storm you wrought on my soul, seeks its end, in peace when it may strike against my fragile little heart with all its might, even thus my heart rebels and sings for thee my lord. "I want thee, and only thee!"
