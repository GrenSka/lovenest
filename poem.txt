If thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it.
I shall keep still and wait like the night with starlit vigil and its head bent low with patience.
The morning shall surely come, its darkness shall vanish, and thy voice pour down in radiant streams tearing through the sky.
Then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds' nests, and thy melodies shall break forth in flowers in all my forest groves. For all my fragile heart might bear, thou hast truly become my world. Oh my master!
